Make -c option to `cast reg` create the root directory if it's missing instead of throwing an error or add another option for this behaviour.

Add simple script portability between templates.


fsys package:

batch move files/dirs from different locations to other different locations

batch rename files/dirs from different locations

batch delete files/dirs from different locations

batch process files/dirs through functions and 3rd party scripts

compare files and directories - find common, differences, missing


template package:

ability to set files/dirs as ignored and not require them to conform

use a templating language for files and initialize values when creating instances


template hooks:
cd into a template by name (similarly to workon with virtualenvs)
