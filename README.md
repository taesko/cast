# File System Templates (FST)
> command line app and daemon that provides file system templates.

FST is a tool to manage multiple directories that have a common
structure. It allows modifications of one directory to be propagated to
the others. 

## Usage
In order to manage multiple directories they must first be connecting to a
common parent template - which is just another directory that defines
the structure (subdirectory tree). Multiple different templates are supported.

#### Terminology
template - directory on the file system that serves to provide a common 
	structure for others. Generally has only empty subdirectories inside it.
instance - another directory connected to a template. Instances are 
	regular directories on disk.

#### Example usage
```sh
 mkdir ~/Music/template
 fst -t music -a ~/Music/template/
 mkdir ~/Music/Eminem
 fst -t music -c ~/Music/Eminem/
 fstd
```

The last command `fstd` starts a daemon that watches all template directories
for modifications and does the appropirate updates to the instances.
Register any other directory to that template as it's instance

## Documentation
